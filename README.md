lol this is unethical.

So just go to main.js and copy into kahoot.it console (after the page loads). Type "YES" and then click the auto submit thing. Once in a game (or just asks for nickname) it will probably say that the game has ended :( . Well if not, you are lucky. When it does fail, click reset and the pause, and then play (just click pause twice i think). Bam i hope you land into some random kahoot game.

Note: "last" id is very unreliable. I will fix this soon so you can bot it or get other friends to join. (I prob wont fix because its kinda hard to fix lol)
